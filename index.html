        of Science in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University, I have been working as a Biomedical Equipment Specialist at 
        Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where I maintained, troubleshot, and repaired a wide range of medical devices used in 
        the operating room. While working full-time, I attended Stevens Institute of Technology to acquire my Master of Science in 
        Computer Science. My graduate studies resulted in the development of a command-line program used to analyze genealogical data, 
        a recipe sharing social media web application, and a COVID-19 information hub where users can find current infection statistics 
        and schedule testing at nearby locations! As I begin my search for new opportunities, I am in the early stages of creating a 
        simple personal budgeting web application using the tried and proven 50-30-20 budgeting rule (feel free to ask me about it!). 
        All these experiences have helped me to become a more effective communicator within and across teams and pushed me to thrive in
